# Known Errors
This version only supports an ASCII user interface with basic communication between client and server as of now. There is also a sample GUI that can be used as a template of how the final deliverable will look like. As of now, the GUI can "login" with a text file that saves account information but can not truly add friends from different clients as of yet. Will update as soon as possible.
